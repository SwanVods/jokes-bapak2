# Jokes Bapak2 API

âš  Still work in progress

## Brief explanation of what is this

This project will be a website like icanhazdadjokes but in Indonesian version and it's not text, it's images. Dad jokes in Indonesia is somewhat a bit different than in US/UK because I guess here, it's a lot dumber.

Anyway, later you can consume this API via a website (that I'll create later on when this is finished) with a few endpoints:

 * `/` - Random jokes bapak2
 * `/id/[number]` - Jokes bapak2 based on ID

Currently I'm searching for an alternative for AWS S3 that I can use for free.

## Tech stacks

 * Base (Node / Go)
 * PostgreSQL

That's it.
