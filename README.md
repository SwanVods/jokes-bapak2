# Jokes Bapak2 API

âš  Still work in progress

## Brief explanation of what is this

This project will be a website like icanhazdadjokes but in Indonesian version and it's not text, it's images. Dad jokes in Indonesia is somewhat a bit different than in US/UK because I guess here, it's a lot dumber.

## Project Directories

* `api` - REST API service. Created with Go.
* `client` - Front facing website (front end). Created with Vite.js

Anyway, later you can consume this API via a website (that will be created later on when this is finished) with a few endpoints:

 * `/v1/` - Random jokes bapak2
 * `/v1/id/[number]` - Jokes bapak2 based on ID
 * `/v1/today` - Jokes bapak2 of the day

Currently I'm searching for an alternative for AWS S3 that I can use for free.

## Tech stacks

 * Go
 * 

That's it.
