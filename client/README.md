# Jokes Bapak2 API

Still work in progress

## Development

```bash
# Install modules
$ yarn install

# Run local server
$ yarn dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
$ yarn dev -- --open

# build everything
$ yarn build
```

> You can preview the built app with `yarn preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
